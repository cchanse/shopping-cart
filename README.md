# Shopping Cart

This exercise was part of the MIT xPro Full Stack Development with MERN Course. In building this cart, we integrated a React front end with the back end and used tools like Strapi, Postman, Express, and node.

## How to Run

* [Clone this GitHub repo.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)
* [Set up a Strapi database.](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html)
* [You can test Strapi API endpoints using Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
* Open up the index.html file in a browser to view the shopping cart.


## Roadmap

* Improve the ui for the cart
* When a user clicks on checkout, it should clear the cart
* The restocking functionality
